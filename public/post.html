                  <p> In reading my blog I assume you want to learn how to code, and because of this I will be hard on you at times and I will lend a hand at other times. So lets start with getting your text editor and installing Ruby. </p>
                    <p>Go to http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ to get your text editor ready. This is crucial, as soon you'll be writing code. Textwrangler comes pretty much configured how you would want it so don't worry too much about it. We will tweak it along the way, if needed. Put textwrangler on your Dock and put the Command Line on your dock. If you don't know how to find your Command Line, Google it. I want you to learn to think like a programmer. Run your Command Line program. If you don't know how to do that, Google it or keep reading. Once you run it, it will look kind of empty, thats normal. In your Command Line, run irb (Interavtive Ruby). Things are ran in the Command Line by just typing their names and hitting enter. </p>

                    <p>If irb is not running (irb is not recognized) Install it using the RVM Ruby Version Manager. Again, Google it. To get out of irb simply hit control D. Hopefully, you see the same thing as you did before you ran irb, if you don't. Google it.  </p>

                    <p>Now in your Command Line I want you to make a directory(file) and the way you do this is by typing this acroynm: mkdir and right after the file name. (example: mkdir rubyfile) and I want you to learn how to change directories and the way to do this is simply by putting this acroynm: cd (change directory) (example: cd rubyfolder) this tells your Command Line to change directory into whatever folder you specified. (Pro tip: if you type cd and the first letter of wherever you're trying to go and press tab, Command Line will autofill the rest for you)</p>

                    <p>Use your editor to create a file in this directory(folder). You will make the file, ‚ÄúSave‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave As...‚Äù, and pick this directory. Go back to the Command Line by just using your keyboard, you can do this by holding command and pressing tab at the same time. Back in the Command Line see if you can list the directory to see your new file. If you don't know how to do this, Google it. (Hint: Google this term "ls Command Line") </p>



                    <p>OSX: This is what I did, see if you can figure out the differences between what I did and what you have done:

                    <p>If you are not comfortable with your text editor go back and practice saving and editing your file until you are.</p>
                    <p> To begin, the word "<b>puts</b>" tells the computer to print out whatever you put in the " " after the word puts.

                    <br> puts<b> "Hello World!"</b>
                    <br> puts<b> "Hello Again, World!"</b>
                    <br> puts<b> "I enjoy typing this."</b>
                    <br> puts<b> "This is fun."</b>
                    <br> puts<b> 'Look! I'm Printing.'</b>
                    <br> puts<b> "I'd much rather you print this."</b>
                    <br> puts<b> 'I "said" print this.'</b>
                    <br><b>Type this</b> don't copy and paste it,<b> type it</b> and save it in your computer under rubyex1.rb (The .rb tells the computer this is a ruby file)<br> Then run the ruby file on your Command Line by typing </br><br>ruby rubyex1.rb</br>

                    <p><h2> What your output should look like:  </p></h2>
                    <p> Assuming you did this correctly this should be your output: </p>
                    <br> Hello World!</b>
                    <br> Hello Again, World!</b>
                    <br> I enjoy typing this.</b>
                    <br> This is fun.</b>
                    <br> Look! I'm Printing.</b>
                    <br> I'd much rather you print this.</b>
                    <br> I "said" print this.</b>
                    <p><br> If your Command Line isn't printing this, you did something wrong. Go back and check what you did wrong, fix it and move on to exercise two.</p></br>


                    <p>If you have an error it will look like this:
                      <br>ruby ex1.rb</br>
                      <br>ex1.rb:4: syntax error, unexpected tCONSTANT,</br> expecting $end</br>
                      <br>puts "This is fun."</br>
                                    ^</p>

                    <p>Its imperative that you learn how to read these errors because you will see them over and over again so lets break this down line by line:
                      <br>1. Here we ran our command in the Command Line to run the ex1.rb script.</br>
                      <br>2. Ruby then tells us that the file ex1.rb has an error on line 4.</br>
                      <br>3. It then prints this line for us.</br>
                      <br>4. Then it puts a ^ (caret) character to point at where the problem is.</br>
                      <br>5. Finally, it prints out a ‚Äúsyntax error‚Äù and tells us something about what might be the error. Usually these are
                      very cryptic, but if you copy that text into a search engine, you will find someone else who‚Äôs had that error and
                      you can probably figure out how to fix it.</br>

                      <p>Extra Credit:
                      <br> Try writing additional lines in your code to see what prints</br> </p>
